# Publication Preparation Notes

## Ready for Publication ✅

The typed-mind-vscode-extension is now prepared for publication to the VSCode Marketplace with the following changes made:

### Completed Preparation Tasks:
1. ✅ Updated package.json with proper publisher ID ("sammons")
2. ✅ Fixed extension name (removed @sammons/ scope prefix)
3. ✅ Added all required fields: name, displayName, description, version, engines, categories, keywords
4. ✅ Updated README.md with proper VSCode extension documentation
5. ✅ Added CHANGELOG.md with version history
6. ✅ Enhanced .vscodeignore to exclude unnecessary files from published extension
7. ✅ Verified "vsce package" script exists in package.json
8. ✅ Confirmed extension ID follows pattern: sammons.typed-mind-vscode-extension
9. ✅ Updated repository field to point to correct GitHub repo
10. ✅ Added all available themes to contribution points
11. ✅ Enhanced keywords and categories for better discoverability

## ⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED: Missing Icon

**IMPORTANT**: You need to add an `icon.png` file to the root directory before publishing.

### Icon Requirements:
- **Size**: 128x128 pixels
- **Format**: PNG
- **Name**: icon.png (already configured in package.json)
- **Content**: Should represent TypedMind DSL or accessibility features
- **Background**: Preferably transparent or dark theme compatible

### Suggested Icon Ideas:
- Typography-focused design with "TM" or "TypedMind"
- Accessibility symbol combined with code/language elements
- Colorblind-friendly design using the extension's color palette
- Clean, modern design that scales well in VS Code

## Publication Commands

Once the icon is added, you can publish using:

```bash
# Package the extension
pnpm run package

# Login to VS Code Marketplace (one-time setup)
vsce login sammons

# Publish to marketplace
vsce publish

# Or publish specific version
vsce publish patch  # 1.0.1
vsce publish minor  # 1.1.0  
vsce publish major  # 2.0.0
```

## Extension ID
The extension will be published as: `sammons.typed-mind-vscode-extension`
