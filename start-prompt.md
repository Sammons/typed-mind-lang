I am working on a DSL with the following reqs:

1. optimized for LLMs
   1. Semantically intuitive
   2. Supporting token efficient short-hands for long form syntax
2. statically checked for validity, e.g. no orphans
3. targeted at TypeScript
4. with excellent error messages, including line number
5. intended to be rendered into an interactive program architecture


I have some draft artifacts so far related to this:
 - ./parser.md
 - ./renderer.md
 - ./specification.md
